# MicroBlocks.CFG (1.12.2)

This config is used with the Minecraft 1.12.2 version of the [ForgeMultipart-CBE](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forge-multipart-cbe) mod that you can find on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/forge-multipart-cbe).

This microblocks.cfg includes real blocks only.

I don't want to have machines or other useless stuff cut to pieces because it makes no sense to me.

If you want to contribute to this config, please check in game that the microblocks looks or works like intended.
